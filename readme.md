# billy-bot
A basic (and trash) Discord bot written in Python.

Relies on [Pycord](https://pycord.dev/) and a few other things to function. 

# Installing:
This assumes you have Python3 + Pip set up on the PATH.
1) Clone the repo
2) Open your fav terminal in the root
3) Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` and hit enter
4) Create a text file named "token.txt" in the root and put your Bot's token in there
8) In your terminal type `main.py`
